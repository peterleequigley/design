## Executive summary
Overall keyboard navigability for Formbricks is very good, even when drilled into site subsections. There are no navigability issues that critically harm the user experience; almost all items address elements excluded from focusability via the Tab/Shift+Tab cycle.
The below audit items were generated on the basis of a user navigating Formbricks exclusively with keyboard commands (as recommended by the [UK Home Office guide to keyboard accessibility](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/accessibility/forms/keyboard)).

- The Tab key should advance to the next focusable element. Shift+Tab should recede to the previous focusable element.
- The Enter key should submit forms, activate buttons, confirm selections, etc.
- The arrow keys should allow for navigation within lists, drop-downs, and selected elements.
- The Esc key should close dialogs and pop-ups, and should generally cancel the active action.
